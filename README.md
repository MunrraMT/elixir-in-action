about the technology

Elixir is the perfect choice for mission-critical software. Its fault-tolerance and concurrency capabilities let it seamlessly handle huge numbers of users and data, and its functional programming mindset means Elixir applications are predictable, readable, and easy to maintain. Start coding in Elixir, and you’ll get instant access to the battle-tested Erlang virtual machine that powers this awesome language, along with Elixir’s own thriving ecosystem of resources. It’s the reliable solution you need for everything from a large-scale distributed system to a simple web app.
about the book

Elixir in Action, Third Edition teaches you to build production-quality distributed applications and highly available server-side systems using Elixir. This new edition is fully updated with the latest versions and features of the language. You’ll start with the foundations of the Erlang platform that underpins Elixir, then quickly progress to functional and concurrent programming. Discover how the OTP framework can radically reduce tedious low-level coding tasks, and explore practical approaches to concurrency as you learn to distribute a production system over multiple machines. Throughout, code samples and real-world examples make sure you’re learning hands-on.
